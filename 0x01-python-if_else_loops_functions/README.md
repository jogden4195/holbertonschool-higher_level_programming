## What you should learn from this project
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* Why indentation is so important in Python
* How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values to variables
* How to use the `while` and `for` loops
* How is Python's `for` different from C's?
* How to use the `break` and `continue` statements
* How to use `else` clauses on loops
* What does the `pass` statement do, and when to use it
* How to use `range`
* What is a function and how do you use functions

* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Tasks

| Task Name | Description | File Name |
| --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Positive anything is better than negative nothing | Python script that generates a random number between -10 and 10 and prints out whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. | 0-positive_or_negative.py |
| The last digit | Python script that generated a random signed number and prints the last digit of that number and prints out whether it is greater than 5, less than 6 and not zero, or zero. | 1-last_digit.py |
| I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game | Python program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase | 2-print_alphabet.py |
|When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off | Python program that prints the alphabet (except for `q` and `e`) in lowercase | 3-print_alphabt.py |
| Hexadecimal printing | Python program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and hexadecimal | 4-print_hexa.py |
| 00...99 | Python program that prints numbers from `0` to `99` | 5-print_comb2.py |
| Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need | Python program that prints all possible different combos of two digits. | 6-print_comb3.py |
| islower | Python function that checks for lowercase character | 7-islower.py |
| To uppercase | Python function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line | 8-uppercase.py |
| There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; its what we do with them that's important | Python function that prints the last digit of a number | 9-print_last_digit.py |
| a+b | Python function that adds 2 integers and returns the result | 10-add.py |
